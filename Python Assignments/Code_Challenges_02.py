# Given strings a and b, return a single string with a and b separated
# by a space '<a> <b>', except swap the first 2 chars of each string.
# e.g.
#   'mix', pod' -> 'pox mid'
#   'dog', 'dinner' -> 'dig donner'
# Assume a and b are length 2 or more.


'''Hands On'''
# Given a string s, print the string again
# where all occurences of its first char have
# been changed to '*', except do not change
# the first char itself.
# e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'
# Assume that the string is length 1 or more.
# Hint: try using replace function


'''Hands On'''
# Given a string, find the first appearance of the
# substring 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows
# the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring
# with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# So 'This dinner is not that bad!' yields:
# This dinner is good!
