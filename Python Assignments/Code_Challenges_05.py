Code Challenge

Consider the following problem, where you want to create a new dictionary 
where the key is a number divisible by 2 in a range of 0-10 and 
it's value is the square of the number. 

First write the solution using for loop and then rewrite using Comprehension

"""


Solution 1:
# Using for loop
numbers = range(10)
new_dict_for = {}

# Add values to `new_dict` using for loop
for n in numbers:
    if n%2==0:
        new_dict_for[n] = n**2

print(new_dict_for)


Solution 2:
# Using dictionary comprehension
new_dict_comp = {n:n**2 for n in numbers if n%2 == 0}

print(new_dict_comp)

Solution:
