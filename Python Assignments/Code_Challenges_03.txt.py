# Given a string, if its length is at least 3,
# add 'ing' to its end.
# Unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case
# add 'ly' instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Print the resulting string.


'''Hands On'''
# Consider dividing a string into two halves.
# If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.
# If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half.
# e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form
#  a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back

Problem Statement:
    Write a program that asks the user, again and again, to enter a number.
    When the user enters an empty string, then stop asking for additional inputs.
    Along the way, as the user is entering numbers, 
    I want you to store those numbers in a list. 
    I also want you to keep track of the minimum and maximum values that you've seen so far.
    When the user has finished entering numbers, your program should print out:
         The sum of these numbers
         The average (mean) of these numbers
         The largest and smallest numbers you received from the user
